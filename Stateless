The major difference between stateful and stateless is whether or not they store data regarding their sessions, and how they respond to requests.
Stateful services keep track of sessions or transactions and respond to the same inputs in different ways depending on their history. 
Clients maintain sessions for stateless services, which are focused on activities that manipulate resources rather than the state.

REST APIs are stateless because, rather than relying on the server remembering previous requests, REST applications require each request to contain 
all of the information necessary for the server to understand it. Storing session state on the server violates the REST architectureâ€™s stateless requirement. 
As a result, the client must handle the complete session state.
